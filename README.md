### Hi there 👋

Yeah, I'll leave the heading as it is because GitHub has made it for me 😇

I've found the way to publish own README.md to profile page thank to **maxlath**'s [profile](https://github.com/maxlath/maxlath "Navigate to maxlath"). I didn't know on this feature on GitHub. It is awesome 🤙

### Some stuff here

> \[I've copy-pasted GitHub's suggestions what to write here\]

- 🔭 I’m currently (outside main job, of course, maybe :)) working on collecting and organising info regarding Translation/Localisation of Open Source Projects into Ukrainian Laguage. Here is a project's [website](https://vk0xorg.github.io/floss2ua/) (hosted on Github). Previously the project was located [here](https://vk0xorg.github.io/os2ua/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [inventaire.io](https://inventaire.io/welcome). But it's not true.
